    # [canceled] The user has ended their subscription. Subscription will not
    #   be processed.

    #   conditions for canceling the subscription have not been met. Subscription
    #   will continue to be processed until the subscription is canceled and
    #   the conditions are met.

    #   will no longer be processed
